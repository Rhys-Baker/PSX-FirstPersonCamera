# PSX-FirstPersonCamera
This is a hobby project I spent a few days on. I wanted to learn the basics of PSX development and this is where I'm at.

I would like to give a huge thanks to spicyjpeg, without who's tutorial series I could not have created this.
The ps1-bare-metal tutorial series can be found at: https://github.com/spicyjpeg/ps1-bare-metal

I would also like to thank the wonderful people on the PSX.Dev Discord server.
